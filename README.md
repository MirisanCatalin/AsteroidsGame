## âœ¨ Features

This game implements core mechanics from the original arcade classic, managed through an Object-Oriented approach:

- **Classic Gameplay:** Control a spaceship with thrust and rotation.
- **Dynamic Asteroids:** Asteroids break into smaller pieces when shot, making the game progressively more challenging.
- **Weapons System:** Standard laser shots and a limited-use **Bomb** mechanic (`bomb.py`).
- **Power-Ups:** Collect **New Life** drops that randomly spawn (`lifespawner.py`, `new_life.py`).
- **High Score Tracking:** Saves and displays the persistent high score using `highscore.txt`.
- **Visual Effects:** Includes ship thrust effects and asteroid **explosions** (`explosion.py`).
